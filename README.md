Logistic Regression: Binary and Multi-Class Classification

This repository demonstrates how to implement Logistic Regression for both binary classification and multi-class classification problems using Python and scikit-learn.

üîç What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for classification problems. It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class.

Unlike linear regression (which predicts continuous outputs), logistic regression is used when the output is categorical, such as 0/1, true/false, yes/no, or even multi-class categories like species of flowers.

üß© How It Works

Logistic Regression computes a weighted sum of input features and applies the sigmoid function to squash the result into a range between 0 and 1.

The output can be interpreted as the probability that the input belongs to a particular class.

Based on a threshold (commonly 0.5), the probability is then mapped to class labels (e.g., 0 or 1).
